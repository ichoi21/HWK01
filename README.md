# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The assignment is to take the provided existing code and to refract it to it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 

"Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it."

The idea here is to ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient.  The exercise should allow for the client (instructor and TAs) to see the skills learned over the past previous lessons throught the codes 

## Acceptance Criteria
